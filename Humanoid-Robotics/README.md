# 🤖 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Capstone Hackathon Project — AI Meets the Physical World

# Author: Rabia Rizwan

# 🚀 Overview

This project bridges the gap between AI agents and physical humanoid robots by integrating robotics simulation tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac with modern AI capabilities.

The goal is to create an autonomous humanoid robot system capable of perceiving, planning, and acting in virtual or real environments—with an integrated AI-driven UI for control.

# 🎯 Project Goals

Create a functional pipeline between digital AI agents and physical humanoid robots

Simulate robotic behaviors in Unity, Gazebo, and Isaac Sim

Demonstrate AI-driven perception, navigation, and manipulation

Enable simple deployment from simulation to real hardware

Provide a clean and modern web UI for robot control

# 🧠 Core Theme
AI Systems in the Physical World — Embodied Intelligence

- Robots are not just mechanical structures…
- They become intelligent beings when combined with perception, planning, and AI reasoning.
